WHAT'S THE ZOMBIE CURE?
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
People keep asking me what's this cure about
Why do I say we're zombies, what's my angle
I tell them it's simple, no conspiracy clout
Just waking up from lies that keep us tangled

[Verse 2]
We shuffle through life believing what we're told
That history's honest and the news is true
But once you see the patterns centuries old
You can't unsee it, changes your whole view

[Chorus]
The zombie cure is opening your eyes
Looking up facts instead of swallowing lies
The zombie cure is following the money
From their pockets to yours, ain't it funny?
We're all just walking dead until we see
The truth that sets our zombie minds free

[Verse 3]
They manufacture consent like Chomsky wrote
Five corporations own what millions think
Operation Mockingbird ain't just a note
The CIA and news had quite a link

[Verse 4]
So what's the cure? It's simple as can be
Stop taking their word, look it up yourself
Primary sources set your thinking free
Put their propaganda back upon the shelf

[Bridge]
Check the Congressional Record
Check the patent files
Check who got rich
From our denial
The truth's not hidden
It's in plain sight
We just been programmed
Not to see the light

[Verse 5]
Share what you learn in songs or simple talk
Don't preach or argue, just present the facts
One zombie at a time begins to walk
Awake and angry at these hidden acts

[Final Chorus]
The zombie cure ain't magic or divine
It's reading what they wrote in their own hand
The zombie cure is yours and also mine
To wake our neighbors up across this land
The walking dead can live again, you'll see
When truth becomes our new reality

[Tag - Spoken]
Senate Church Committee, 1975
Operation Mockingbird, all documented
Manufacturing Consent by Chomsky, 1988
It's all there, waiting
The only question is...
Are you cured yet?
