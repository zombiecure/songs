THE BANANA WARS
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
From eighteen ninety-eight to thirty-four
The Marines invaded southern shores
Twenty-eight times with guns and might
To keep bananas cheap and white

[Verse 2]
United Fruit had its own foreign policy
When countries tried democracy
One phone call to Washington D.C.
And here come the boys from the military

[Chorus]
These are the Banana Wars
Your breakfast built on blood
These are the Banana Wars
Marines through the jungle mud
Honduras seven times
Nicaragua occupied
Guatemala's democracy died
For a forty-nine cent bunch
Of bananas in your lunch

[Verse 3]
Smedley Butler wore the uniform proud
Till he saw what it was all about
"I was a gangster for capitalism" he said
"A muscle man for business interests" he confessed

[Verse 4]
Made Mexico safe for American oil
Haiti for National City Bank's spoil
Nicaragua for Brown Brothers' greed
China safe for Standard Oil's need

[Bridge]
The countries that send refugees today?
We destroyed them along the way
Installed dictators, killed democracy's hope
Now we wonder why they can't cope

[Verse 5]
Chiquita's just the new name on the door
Same company, same colonial war
The price of empire on your table sits
Yellow fruit grown from bloodied bits

[Final Chorus]
These were the Banana Wars
But they never really ended
Corporate fruit conquistadors
With profits well-defended
From United Fruit to Chiquita brand
Same blood upon the land
Next time you peel that yellow skin
Remember where your breakfast has been

[Outro - Spoken]
Major General Smedley Butler, 1933:
"War is a racket... I helped make Mexico safe for American oil
I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for National City Bank"
National Security Archive, George Washington University
28 interventions documented
100,000+ Central Americans killed
For bananas
Look at the Chiquita label
That's history you're holding
