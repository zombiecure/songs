30 CENTS AN HOUR
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
McDonald's uniforms made behind the wall
By prisoners who barely get paid at all
Thirty cents an hour for a ten hour day
The Thirteenth Amendment lets slavery stay

[Verse 2]
"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude
Except for a crime" - there's the loophole crude
So they lock up millions, mostly Black and brown
And sell their labor all over town

[Chorus]
Thirty cents an hour
That's the modern slave wage
Thirty cents an hour
Working in a cage
From license plates to office chairs
Military helmets to Victoria's Secret wears
American slavery never went away
It just moved behind walls where it stays

[Verse 3]
Federal Prison Industries, UNICOR's the name
Five hundred million dollars in their game
One hundred percent of military gear
Made by prisoners who disappear

[Verse 4]
Texas and Georgia don't pay nothing at all
Zero dollars for breaking your back at their call
Louisiana pays two cents at Angola prison
Built on a plantation - ain't that fitting?

[Bridge]
Refuse to work? Solitary confinement
No unions allowed, no labor alignment
Walmart, Starbucks, AT&T
Profit from prison slavery

[Verse 5]
California inmates fighting fire
Dollar an hour in the flame and dire
Saving the state millions every year
But can't be firefighters when they're clear

[Final Chorus]
Thirty cents an hour, sometimes even less
Modern chain gangs in the land of the blessed
The Constitution says it's legal and fine
As long as you commit the crime
Of being poor and Black in the wrong place
That's a ten-year sentence at the modern slave wage

[Outro - Spoken]
13th Amendment: "except as a punishment for crime"
Prison wages: $0.20 to $1.00/hour
Texas and Georgia: $0.00
Companies using prison labor: McDonald's, Walmart, 
Starbucks, Victoria's Secret, AT&T, and 3,094 more
Your "Made in USA" might mean made by slaves
Check UNICOR's catalog online
It's all there in black and white
