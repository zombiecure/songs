THE PRISON PIPELINE
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
They closed the school on Martin Luther King
Built a new jail where the children used to sing
Same kids who needed books and teachers' care
Now fill the cells at thirty grand a year

[Verse 2]
It starts in kindergarten with the cops in halls
Suspensions for what used to be kids' brawls
A criminal record by the age of ten
The pipeline's working, trapping them again

[Chorus]
From the schoolhouse to the big house
That's the plan they made
Defund education, build incarceration
A more profitable trade
Five percent of the world but twenty-five of its cages
The prison pipeline through the ages
Slavery by another name
Same players, different game

[Verse 3]
Private prison stocks up a thousand percent
Since the tough on crime movement began its ascent
CoreCivic and GEO Group count their cash
While families get destroyed in the backlash

[Verse 4]
They guarantee ninety percent occupancy rates
That means they need bodies behind those gates
So they lobby for laws that fill their cells
Three strikes and mandatory minimums from hell

[Bridge]
Follow the money from the judge to the jail
From the politician to the corporate tail
JP Morgan, Wells Fargo invest
In keeping cages full, profits blessed

[Verse 5]
One in three Black men will see a cell
The new Jim Crow works perfectly well
From slave ship to plantation to the modern cage
Different chapter but the same damn page

[Final Chorus]
The school to prison pipeline ain't broken
It works exactly as designed and spoken
Take their education, give them time
For the shareholder value crime
Where children used to learn to read
Now Wall Street plants its poison seed

[Outro - Spoken]
U.S. incarceration rate: 639 per 100,000
Next highest democracy: 109 per 100,000
Prison stocks since 2000: Up 1,000%
Cost to educate: $12,000/year
Cost to incarcerate: $35,000/year
They chose the profitable option
Your kids might be next
