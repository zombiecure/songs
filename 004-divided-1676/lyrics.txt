THEY DIVIDED US IN 1676
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
In sixteen seventy-six down in Virginia way
Poor whites and Black folks rose up the same day
Bacon's Rebellion had the masters scared
When we stood together, the rich men despaired

[Verse 2]
So they wrote new laws in sixteen ninety-one
Said "white" means something, and the division begun
Gave poor whites just enough to feel they're better
While keeping all of us in chains and fetters

[Chorus]
They divided us, they divided us
In sixteen seventy-six
When we almost won together
They played their oldest tricks
Still works today, still works today
Look around and see
They keep us fighting each other
So we'll never be free

[Verse 3]
Before that rebellion, we were all just poor
Irish, African, English, all slaves to be sure
But unity threatened the plantation class
So they invented race to save their ass

[Verse 4]
Give the poor whites a badge and a penny more pay
Tell them they're superior in every way
While the rich man's counting money in his mansion
Built on all our backs through his clever expansion

[Bridge]
Every strike that's broken
Every union that falls
It's the same old story
Writing on the walls
They whisper about color
While they steal from us all

[Verse 5]
From Matewan to Memphis, the pattern's clear
When we unite, it's the only thing they fear
So they fund division on the nightly news
Keep us angry at each other, singing the blues

[Final Chorus]
They divided us, they divided us
And we're still falling for it
Three hundred fifty years later
Same game, same old shit
Wake up now, wake up now
See through their design
The color of our collars matters more
Than the color of our skin in the mine

[Outro - Spoken]
Look it up - Bacon's Rebellion, 1676
Virginia Slave Codes, 1691
The only war that matters is rich against poor
Everything else is just to keep us at each other's throats
Are you ready to see it?
