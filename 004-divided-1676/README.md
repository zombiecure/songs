# Source Documentation: "They Divided Us in 1676"

## Song Overview
This song exposes how Bacon's Rebellion (1676) led to the deliberate creation of racial divisions to prevent poor whites and enslaved Africans from uniting against wealthy elites. The aftermath established the racial caste system that still divides working people today.

## Core Claims and Verification

### Claim 1: Bacon's Rebellion united poor whites and enslaved Africans

**PRIMARY SOURCES:**
- **Virginia Colonial Records** - Documented participation of both groups
- **Governor Berkeley's Reports to England** - Expressed fear of unified uprising
- **"The Old Dominion in the Seventeenth Century" by Warren M. Billings**

**VERIFICATION:**
- ✅ Rebellion included indentured servants, enslaved Africans, and free blacks
- ✅ United against colonial elite's monopoly on Indian trade
- ✅ Burned Jamestown to the ground in September 1676

### Claim 2: Virginia passed race laws immediately after to divide rebels

**SLAVE CODES OF 1705:**
- **"An Act Concerning Servants and Slaves"**
- Made all servants brought into country who were not Christians in native country slaves for life
- Their children also slaves
- Established "white" as legal category with privileges

**SPECIFIC LAWS PASSED:**
- 1680: Prevented blacks from bearing arms
- 1682: Slaves could not gather or own property
- 1691: Outlawed interracial marriage
- 1705: Comprehensive slave code establishing racial hierarchy

### Claim 3: Created "white" identity as control mechanism

**ACADEMIC SOURCES:**
- **"The Invention of the White Race" by Theodore W. Allen**
- **"Birth of a White Nation" by Jacqueline Battalora**
- Before 1676, poor Europeans identified by nationality (English, Irish, etc.)
- "White" first appears in Virginia law in 1691

**VERIFICATION:**
- ✅ Poor whites given small privileges: could own guns, testify in court
- ✅ Created buffer class between elite and enslaved
- ✅ Pattern replicated across colonies

### Claim 4: Elite's deliberate strategy documented

**COLONIAL RECORDS:**
- Virginia House of Burgesses debates (1676-1705)
- Letters between planters discussing need to "prevent future combinations"
- Economic incentives created for poor whites to become slave patrollers

## Historical Pattern Evidence

### Elite's Problem
- Outnumbered 100:1 by poor whites and enslaved Africans
- Both groups faced similar exploitation
- United rebellion threatened entire system

### Elite's Solution  
- Create racial categories in law
- Give poor whites minor privileges
- Make them enforce slavery for small rewards
- Psychological wage of "at least I'm not black"

## Modern Parallels

Same divide-and-conquer tactics:
- Immigration debates pit poor whites against immigrants
- "Replacement theory" prevents class solidarity
- Prison system maintains racial divisions
- Wage gaps keep groups fighting each other not bosses
