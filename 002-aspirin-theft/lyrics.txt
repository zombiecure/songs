THE ASPIRIN THEFT
by The Zombie Cure Collective

[Verse 1]
For a thousand years or more, they say
Natives chewed willow bark to ease the pain
Grandmothers' wisdom passed down through time
Free medicine growing by the streamside

[Chorus]
But someone had to steal it, patent it, and sell it back
That's the American way, paint it white and jack the price
Forty thousand tons a year, billion dollar industry
Built on stolen medicine, and they never paid a fee

[Verse 2]
1897, Felix Hoffmann at Bayer
Synthesized the compound, called it their own layer by layer
March 6, 1899, US Patent secured
Turned sacred healing into profits, that's how theft gets cured

[Bridge]
Look it up yourself, Patent 644-077
Smithsonian confirms what the Natives knew toward heaven
Every pill you swallow for your aching head
Is stolen Indigenous knowledge, but their names are never said

[Verse 3]
Now I'm 63 and just learned this last week
Makes me wonder what else they stole while we were asleep
From willow bark to aspirin, from free to commodified
Another chapter in the book of American lies

[Final Chorus]
Someone had to steal it, patent it, and sell it back
That's the American way, paint it white and jack the price
Check your medicine cabinet, see the truth in white pills there
Built on stolen medicine, but we zombies didn't care
