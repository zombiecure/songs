THE GIG ECONOMY HUSTLE
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
Wake up at five, check three apps on my phone
Drive for Uber, deliver lunch, I'm never home
They call me contractor, entrepreneur they say
But I can't afford a doctor if I'm sick today

[Verse 2]
After gas and wear, I'm making six an hour
But the app says I'm my own boss with power
Flexibility they promise, freedom they sell
But I'm trapped in this digital sharecropping hell

[Chorus]
It's the gig economy hustle, the new company store
Work all day and end up poor
No benefits, no rights, no future in sight
Just algorithms squeezing us tight
They spent two hundred million to buy a law
That says we ain't employees at all

[Verse 3]
My car's breaking down from all these miles
The app keeps cutting rates with digital smiles
Five stars or you're done, one bad review
And the algorithm decides you're through

[Verse 4]
Prop Twenty-Two in California passed
Most expensive campaign in ballot history classed
Uber, Lyft, DoorDash bought democracy
Now exploitation's legal, can't you see

[Bridge]
Rent a car from Uber
To drive for Uber
Pay Uber for more rides
While Uber divides
Every dollar that we earn
They take their cut and watch us burn

[Verse 5]
Fifty-seven million Americans in this trap
Working three gigs just to close the gap
They disrupted good jobs with bad ones instead
Now we're all independent and half-dead

[Final Chorus]
The gig economy hustle ain't innovation
It's the oldest exploitation across the nation
Digital sharecroppers in the modern age
Working for the algorithm's minimum wage
Your boss is an app that don't care if you eat
Welcome to serfdom on Silicon Valley's street

[Outro - Spoken]
MIT Study 2018: Uber drivers net $6.20/hour after costs
Prop 22: $224 million spent by gig companies
Most expensive ballot measure in U.S. history
36% of American workers in gig economy
Average income after expenses: Below minimum wage
They call it the future
Looks like the past to me
