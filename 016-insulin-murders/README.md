## The Story
The inventors sold the insulin patent for $1 in 1923, saying it belonged to humanity. Now it's $300 a vial. Diabetics ration doses and die. That's not economics - it's murder.

- Just 3 companies control 90% of insulin
- Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi
- Prices rise in lockstep (collusion?)
- Production cost: $2-4 per vial
- Retail price: $300+ (7,500% markup)

## The Bitter Irony

- "Insulin belongs to the world"
- Modern pharma: "Insulin belongs to shareholders"
- Same medicine, same manufacturing
- Only difference: Greed

## International Comparison
- USA: $300+ per vial
- Canada: $30
- Mexico: $20
