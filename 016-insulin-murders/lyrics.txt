THE INSULIN MURDERS
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
Banting and Best in nineteen twenty-three
Sold the insulin patent for a dollar fee
Said it belongs to the world, not to profit
But pharma companies put it in their pocket

[Verse 2]
Nineteen ninety-six, twenty-one bucks a vial
Now it's three hundred with a corporate smile
Same medicine, same formula to make
But they're killing diabetics for profit's sake

[Chorus]
It's murder with a price tag, killing with a pen
When you ration insulin again and again
Alec was twenty-six when he died
Couldn't afford what kept him alive
They're murdering Americans for corporate gains
While pharma executives count their chains

[Verse 3]
Three companies control ninety percent
Eli Lilly, Novo, Sanofi's intent
They raise prices together, a legal cartel
Making billions while diabetics go through hell

[Verse 4]
Production costs two to four dollars max
Three hundred retail, do the math on the tax
Seven thousand percent markup on life
Cutting diabetics down like a knife

[Bridge]
In Canada it's thirty
Mexico twenty or less
Same vial, same companies
American distress
One in four are rationing
Skipping doses to survive
While CEOs are rationing
Nothing but their lies

[Verse 5]
Josh died at twenty-seven, aged off his parent's plan
Kayla at twenty-eight, did everything she can
They're not statistics, they're murder victims clear
Of a system that says your life's too dear

[Final Chorus]
It's murder when you know the cure
And price it out of reach for poor
The inventors said it free for all
Now it's behind a paywall
Every death certificate should read
Cause of death: Corporate greed

[Outro - Spoken]
Patent sold for $1 in 1923
2024 price: $300+ per vial
Production cost: $2-4
Americans who ration insulin: 1 in 4
Deaths from rationing: Uncounted, but real
Alec Smith, Josh Wilkerson, Kayla Davis
and hundreds more we'll never know
Because poverty isn't listed as cause of death
