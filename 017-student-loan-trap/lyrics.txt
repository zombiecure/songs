STUDENT LOAN TRAP
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
They said get a degree, it's the American way
Work hard, study long, and it'll all pay
But tuition went up twelve hundred percent
While the wages stayed flat, not even increased

[Verse 2]
Sign here at eighteen, don't read the fine print
You'll pay it back easy, here's the hint
But the jobs ain't there and the interest compounds
Now you're drowning in debt, hear the bloodhounds

[Chorus]
One point eight trillion in the student loan trap
Forty-two million with the chain on their back
Can't bankrupt out, can't run away
They'll garnish your Social Security pay
You believed in the dream they were selling
Now you're in economic hell dwelling

[Verse 3]
Sallie Mae became Navient the crook
Steered folks to forbearance by the book
Let the interest grow while you can't pay
Made billions off your decay

[Verse 4]
Public Service Forgiveness, a ten-year lie
Ninety-eight percent rejected when they try
One form wrong from a decade ago
Start over, sucker, didn't you know?

[Bridge]
In Germany college is free
France, Norway, across the sea
But here in the land of the free
You're free to be in debt eternally

[Verse 5]
My neighbor's kid owes eighty grand
Teaching salary thirty-five in hand
Do the math, it don't work out
That's what the trap is all about

[Final Chorus]
The student loan trap ain't no mistake
It's working just fine for the profit they make
Government, servicers, schools all win
While you're caught in the original sin
Of believing education was the way up
Now you're drowning in the debt cup

[Outro - Spoken]
Total student debt: $1.814 trillion
Average: $39,075
Cannot discharge in bankruptcy (2005 law)
Tuition increase since 1980: 1,200%
Wage increase: 20%
Public Service Loan Forgiveness approval: 2%
Other countries with free college: Most of them
The American Dream has a price tag
And compound interest
