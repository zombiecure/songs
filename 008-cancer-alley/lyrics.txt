CANCER ALLEY
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
From Baton Rouge to New Orleans town
Eighty-five miles of poison ground
Two hundred plants spewing in the air
On the same land where slaves used to prayer

[Verse 2]
They built refineries on plantation land
Where sugar cane and cotton used to stand
Now cancer rates are through the roof
EPA's got all the proof

[Chorus]
Welcome to Cancer Alley
Where the air itself will kill
Welcome to Cancer Alley
Where they're poisoning us still
St. John Parish, eight times the cancer rate
Reserve, Louisiana, sealed their fate
Highest risk in the U.S.A.
But the plants keep running every day

[Verse 3]
Shell and Exxon, DuPont and Dow
Making billions while the people bow
To chemotherapy and oxygen tanks
While CEOs laugh to their Swiss banks

[Verse 4]
Ninety-five percent who breathe it are Black
Living on land their ancestors worked on their backs
Environmental racism plain to see
But Louisiana gives them tax breaks for free

[Bridge]
Sharon Lavigne fights for St. James
"We're dying for their profit gains"
Every family's got the cancer curse
While politicians' pockets get more diverse

[Verse 5]
They promise jobs but deliver death
Minimum wage for poisoned breath
The descendants of slaves still ain't free
Just a different chain, a slower misery

[Final Chorus]
This is Cancer Alley
Where corporate profit wins
This is Cancer Alley
Where genocide begins
Not with guns or bombs or blades
But with toxins, tanks, and trades
They plant poison where the poor folks stay
And call it the American way

[Outro - Spoken]
EPA National Air Toxics Assessment 2024:
St. John Parish - 800% higher cancer risk
Reserve, LA - Highest cancer risk in America
Demographics of affected areas: 85-95% Black
Tax breaks to polluters: $1.5 billion annually
Look up your zip code's cancer risk
You might be next
