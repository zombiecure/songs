## The Story
They called it "removal." We call it genocide. 60,000 Native Americans forced from their homes at gunpoint. 15,000 died on the march. Why? Gold was found on their land.

## Verified Facts

## The Five "Civilized" Tribes
- Cherokee: 16,000 removed, 4,000+ died
- Creek: 15,000 removed, 3,500 died
- Choctaw: First removed, hundreds died
- Chickasaw: "Lucky" - only 500-800 died
- Seminole: Fought three wars, never surrendered

## What They Lost
- 25 million acres of ancestral land
- Homes, farms, businesses
- Sacred sites and burial grounds
- Cherokee had their own alphabet, newspaper, constitution
- More "civilized" than the whites who stole from them

## The Gold Rush Connection
- 1829: Gold discovered in Georgia
- Georgia immediately "claimed" Cherokee land
- Supreme Court sided with Cherokee
- Jackson: "Marshall has made his decision, let him enforce it"
- Might made right

## Modern Echoes
- Standing Rock: Same story, oil instead of gold
- Every treaty broken when resources found
- "Sacred land" until there's profit underneath
