THE TRAIL WHERE THEY CRIED
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
Andrew Jackson signed the order in eighteen thirty plain
Said the Cherokee must walk off through the winter rain
They had farms and schools and their own written word
But gold was found, so promises weren't heard

[Verse 2]
Sixteen thousand started marching in the cold
Four thousand died, the young and the old
They called it removal like furniture you arrange
But it was death march for pocket change

[Chorus]
On the trail where they cried
One in four of them died
For the crime of living on gold
Cherokee blood ran cold
They were civilized beyond their killers
Who wanted their land for golden fillers
The Trail of Tears they walked in chains
While Andrew Jackson counted gains

[Verse 3]
The Supreme Court said the Cherokee could stay
Jackson laughed and forced them anyway
"Marshall made his decision, let him enforce it"
When there's gold below, the law gets forfeit

[Verse 4]
Five tribes forced to walk that deadly path
Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw felt the wrath
Seminole fought three wars and never quit
But most were marched into that death pit

[Bridge]
They had newspapers in Cherokee language
Constitution, democracy they managed
More civilized than those who stole
But civilization's defined by gold

[Verse 5]
Twenty-five million acres seized
For farming, mining as they pleased
The death march worked just as designed
Left a whole civilization behind

[Final Chorus]
On the trail where they cried
American democracy died
When you can march people to death
For what lies beneath
Every treaty broken when convenient
Every promise just expedient
The trail ain't just history's stain
It's happening now at Standing Rock again

[Outro - Spoken]
Indian Removal Act, 1830
Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 1831
4,000+ Cherokee died of 16,000
Library of Congress has the records
$25 million in gold extracted from Cherokee land
That's what genocide bought
Standing Rock, 2016
Same story, oil instead of gold
We never stopped marching them
