YOUR GRANDPA'S PENSION
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
Your grandpa worked the steel mill thirty-seven years
Through Depression, war, and boom he stayed
They promised him security to calm his fears
A pension for the loyalty he paid

[Verse 2]
Then Bethlehem Steel filed Chapter Eleven
CEO walked with forty-five million clear
Thirty thousand workers lost their piece of heaven
While executives' golden parachutes appeared

[Chorus]
Where's your grandpa's pension?
Where'd the promise go?
The company store's still open
Just changed its name, you know
From steel mills to fulfillment centers
The game remains the same
Work your whole life building wealth
For men who feel no shame

[Verse 3]
The Pension Benefit Guaranty stepped in
Paid forty cents on every dollar owed
While Robert Miller, that bankruptcy king
Made millions more as pensions got foreclosed

[Verse 4]
He killed the pension at four companies straight
Delphi, Bethlehem, Federal-Mogul too
Each time the workers took the bait
Each time executives sailed right through

[Bridge]
Now it's 401Ks
You bear all the risk
While Wall Street takes their cut
Of every coin and disk
Your grandpa had a promise
You've got a casino chip
Retirement security's
Another sinking ship

[Verse 5]
From defined benefit to defined contribution
From "we got your back" to "you're on your own"
The greatest theft without prosecution
While private equity sits on the throne

[Final Chorus]
Where's your grandpa's pension?
Where's your future too?
The company store just evolved its con
Now the mark is you
Work fifty years, save every dime
And hope the market's kind
'Cause the promise that they made your grandpa
Got left behind

[Outro - Spoken]
Bethlehem Steel bankruptcy: 2001
30,000 pensions dumped
CEO bonus during bankruptcy: $45 million
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
Look it up
Then look at your 401K
Same game, new rules
You just don't know it yet
