## The Story
My buddy's grandpa worked 35 years at Bethlehem Steel. They promised him a pension. Then they declared bankruptcy, dumped the pension on the government, and executives walked away with millions. Sound familiar?

## Chords
Verse:  G - Am - C - G
Chorus: C - G - Am - D - G
Bridge: Em - C - D - G

## Verified Facts
- Bethlehem Steel: 30,000 workers lost promised pensions in 2001
- CEO Robert Miller: Terminated pensions at 4 different companies
- Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp took over at 40 cents on the dollar
- Executive bonuses: $45 million during bankruptcy

## The Pattern
- Promise workers security for loyalty
- Extract decades of labor
- Declare "bankruptcy" when bill comes due
- Executives get golden parachutes
- Workers get government minimums
- Rinse and repeat

## Modern Version
- 401(k) replaced pensions = your problem now
- Private equity strips companies
- Workers lose, Wall Street wins
