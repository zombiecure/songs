"The Day I Learned I Was a Zombie"


Lyrics:
[Intro - Spoken]
"This is a song about the day I figured out I'd been walking around like a zombie for 63 years..."

[Verse 1 - The Lie]
I was taught that hard work always pays
That the system's fair in all its ways
That history books tell us the truth
About this nation since its youth

[Verse 2 - The Truth]
Then I learned about Sand Creek in '64
Where Chivington killed 200 or more
Women and children, a massacre planned
While Denver's gold rush stole their land

[Chorus - Simple Truth]
I was a zombie, believing their lies
Now I'm awake with open eyes
We're all just zombies till we see
The truth that sets our minds free

[Verse 3 - Follow the Money]
Governor Evans made his fortune in gold
While Native blood ran icy cold
Same thing happened at Standing Rock
Energy Transfer's pipeline shock

[Verse 4 - More Revelations]
Henrietta Lacks' cells made billions in gain
Her family got nothing but poverty's pain
George Carver gave his genius for free
While corporations took his legacy

[Bridge - Unity Message]
Black folks, white folks, all in between
We've all been fooled by the same machine
They kept us fighting each other instead
While they got rich and we got dead

[Verse 5 - The Pattern]
From Tulsa's Black Wall Street burned to the ground
To Vietnam's lies that kept us down
From poisoned water in Flint today
It's the same old game they always play
[Outro Tag - Spoken]
"Don't believe me - look it up yourself. Sand Creek, Henrietta Lacks, George Washington Carver. It's all there in the records. I'm just a guy who finally opened his eyes after 63 years of sleepwalking. Question is... are you still a zombie too?"

[Final Chorus - Softer]
We're all just zombies till we see
The truth that sets our minds free
Wake up, wake up, it's not too late
To see through all their lies and hate

Performance Notes:

Simple G-C-D progression throughout
Talking-blues style, half-sung/half-spoken
Emphasis on specific names and dates
Matter-of-fact delivery, not preachy
Let the shocking facts speak for themselves
