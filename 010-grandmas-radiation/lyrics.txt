GRANDMA'S RADIATION
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
Grandma lived in St. George in fifty-three
When the mushroom clouds rose for all to see
They said the fallout couldn't hurt a fly
While they watched the cancer rates multiply

[Verse 2]
One hundred nuclear tests in desert air
Four hundred thousand poisoned unaware
From Utah to Iowa the death dust blew
While the government said "We're protecting you"

[Chorus]
Grandma's radiation came from Uncle Sam
Who tested bombs and didn't give a damn
They called them Downwinders like it was their fault
For living where the death clouds came to halt
Thyroid cancer, leukemia too
All because they trusted red, white, and blue

[Verse 3]
They handed out pamphlets saying "All is well"
"A little radiation never hurt" they'd tell
While classified reports showed the truth they hid
Scientists fired for telling what they did

[Verse 4]
The children born with missing parts and pain
The sheep that died across the poison plain
The gardens that grew tumors with the corn
The babies that were never even born

[Bridge]
It took till nineteen ninety to admit
That maybe radiation ain't legit
Two point four billion paid out so far
If you can prove your grandma's thyroid scar

[Verse 5]
From nuclear tests to Flint's water lies
East Palestine where the vinyl chloride flies
The pattern stays the same throughout the years
"Trust us" means prepare your children's tears

[Final Chorus]
Grandma's radiation was just the start
Of poisoning Americans, the government art
From atomic bombs to factory smoke
It's always poor folks who get to choke
On the ashes of American dreams
While the powerful pretend not to hear the screams

[Outro - Spoken]
Atomic Energy Commission, declassified 1994
They knew the cancer risks in 1953
400,000+ exposed, thousands dead
Compensation: $2.4 billion (if you can prove it)
Flint water crisis, East Palestine, Camp Lejeune
Same playbook, different poison
How many grandmas till we learn?
