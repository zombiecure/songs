## The Story
My friend's grandma lived in St. George, Utah in the 1950s. They called them "Downwinders." The government tested nuclear bombs upwind and told them the fallout was safe. Half the town got cancer.

## Chords
Verse:  Em - C - G - D
Chorus: G - Em - C - D

## Verified Facts
- 100 above-ground nuclear tests (1951-1962)
- 400,000+ "Downwinders" exposed
- Fallout reached Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota
- Cancer rates: 2-8 times higher than normal
- Government knew and lied: "No danger"
- Source: Atomic Energy Commission declassified documents

## What They Told People
- "Radiation is harmless at these levels"
- "Your sacrifice helps defeat communism"
- "Trust your government"
- Handed out pamphlets saying fallout was safe

## The Real Numbers
- Thyroid cancer: 2.5x normal
- Leukemia clusters in children
- Birth defects off the charts
- $2.4 billion paid to victims (so far)
- Only if you can prove it 40 years later

## The Cover-Up

- Scientists who spoke out were fired
- Media was told to stay quiet
- Took until 1990 to admit fault

## Still Happening
- Flint water "safe to drink"
- East Palestine "no long-term danger"
- Camp Lejeune water contamination
- Pattern: Poison first, admit later
