# ðŸ§Ÿ The Zombie Cure: Truth Songs for Awakening

> "I'm 63 years old and I just found out everything I learned in school was propaganda. These songs are my way of dealing with that shock."

## What Is This?

We're all zombies, fed lies since birth. The cure? Truth, delivered in simple songs that stick in your head. No preaching, just facts I discovered that blew my mind.

5. **Free** - Steal these songs, change them, make them yours

## Who Am I?

Just a guy who thought he knew history until last month. Middle-class, white, Christian, veteran - basically believed all the "official stories." Then I started researching for a family history project and... holy shit.

I'm not special. I'm not "woke." I'm just shocked and writing songs about it.
