5. **Free** - Steal these songs, change them, make them yours

## Who's Behind The Zombie Cure Protest Songs?

Just a guy who thought he knew American history until last month. Middle-class, white, Christian, veteran - basically believed all the "official stories." Then I started researching for a family history project and... holy shit.

I'm not special. I'm not "woke." I'm just shocked and writing protest songs about what I found. Maybe those with audiences can share these songs or write better ones. If we all learn the truth, we can make informed decisions. This library grows as I learn more.
