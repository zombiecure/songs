# ðŸ§Ÿ The Zombie Cure: Truth Songs for Awakening

> "I'm 63 years old and I just found out everything I learned in school was propaganda. These songs are my way of dealing with that shock."

## What Is This?

We're all zombies, fed lies since birth. The cure? Truth, delivered in simple songs that stick in your head. No preaching, just facts I discovered that blew my mind.

**Everything here is free. Public domain. No copyright.**
- Download the MP3s
- Learn the chords (usually just 3-5)
- Sing at coffee shops
- Wake up other zombies
- Build a music history library for others to learn from

## The Songs

### Released
1. [The Day I Learned I Was a Zombie](./001-zombie-awakening/) - Personal awakening
2. [The Aspirin Theft](./002-aspirin-theft/) - How Bayer stole Native medicine for billions
3. [Company Store 2.0](./003-company-store/) - Amazon warehouses = 1920s coal camps

### Coming Soon
4. They Divided Us in 1676 - Bacon's Rebellion manufactured race hatred
5. What's the Zombie Cure? - The concept explained
6. Your Grandpa's Pension - How Bethlehem Steel stole it
7. Tulsa's Black Wall Street - The massacre they hid from history
8. Cancer Alley - Environmental racism in Louisiana
9. The Banana Wars - US invasions for United Fruit Company
10. Grandma's Radiation - Nuclear testing on citizens

[See all 17 planned songs â†’](./song-list.md)

## The Rules

1. **Simple** - 3-4 chords max, talking blues style
2. **Specific** - Names, dates, dollar amounts, not vague complaints
3. **Verifiable** - Every claim has a source you can check
4. **Singable** - If you can't hum it after one listen, it failed
5. **Free** - Steal these songs, change them, make them yours

## Who Am I?

Just a guy who thought he knew history until last month. Middle-class, white, Christian, veteran - basically believed all the "official stories." Then I started researching for a family history project and... holy shit.

I'm not special. I'm not "woke." I'm just shocked and writing songs about it. Maybe, just maybe, those who have an audience can present these songs or something better to them. If we all get to knowing the truth then we can be more informed on what we say "Yes" or "No" to. This library will continue to grow as I learn more, what's even more shocking is how much there is to know. If you want a wake up call, read/listen to "Lies My Teacher Told Me" by James W. Wolf.
