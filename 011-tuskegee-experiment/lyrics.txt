THE TUSKEGEE EXPERIMENT
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
Nineteen thirty-two they came to Alabama towns
Said "We'll treat your bad blood" to the Black men they found
Six hundred signed up for the government care
Never knowing it was death that waited there

[Verse 2]
They had syphilis but were never told
Just watched and documented as the disease took hold
When penicillin came in forty-seven's light
They kept it secret, let them die for spite

[Chorus]
Forty years of medical lies
Forty years of wondering why
They felt so sick when help was near
Doctors taking notes on every tear
The Tuskegee Experiment
Your government
Watching Black men die
For science

[Verse 3]
One hundred twenty-eight died from the disease
Forty wives infected if you please
Nineteen children born with poison in their veins
All for research and statistical gains

[Verse 4]
They got free meals and rides to the clinic door
Never knowing they were specimens and nothing more
Told they had bad blood, given sugar pills
While the doctors documented their increasing ills

[Bridge]
Peter Buxtun blew the whistle in seventy-two
The press picked it up and the horror grew
Only public outrage made it stop
After forty years of playing God

[Verse 5]
Clinton apologized in ninety-seven late
To the eight survivors of this medical hate
But the damage echoes through the years
That's why there's vaccine hesitancy and fears

[Final Chorus]
When trust is broken, it don't come back
Especially when the victims are all Black
Tuskegee wasn't an aberration
It was medical exploitation
And every time they say "Trust us, we care"
Remember who wasn't treated there

[Outro - Spoken]
U.S. Public Health Service Study
"Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male"
1932-1972: 40 years
Cure available: 1947
Cure withheld: 25 years
Last survivor died 2004
CDC website has all the details now
They admit everything
Wonder what they're not admitting today?
