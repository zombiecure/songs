## Why This Matters

Every exploitative pattern in American history repeats with updated methods. From slavery to prison labor, from company stores to Amazon warehouses, from stolen Indigenous knowledge to modern pharmaceutical patents. These songs document the patterns so we can recognize and resist them.
