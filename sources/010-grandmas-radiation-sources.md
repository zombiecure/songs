# Source Documentation: "Grandma's Radiation"

## Song Overview
This song exposes how the US government deliberately exposed American civilians to radiation through nuclear testing, with "Downwinders" suffering cancer rates 10x normal. The government knew the dangers but called it "a low-use population segment."

## Core Claims and Verification

### Claim 1: Government conducted nuclear tests knowing fallout would poison civilians

**NUCLEAR TEST STATISTICS:**
- **Nevada Test Site:** 928 nuclear tests (1951-1992)
- **Above ground:** 100 tests (1951-1962)
- **Underground:** 828 tests continued to 1992
- **Pacific Tests:** 67 nuclear tests

**DECLASSIFIED AEC DOCUMENTS:**
- **Atomic Energy Commission memo (1953):** Acknowledged radiation exposure to civilians
- **Project SUNSHINE:** Secret program collecting baby teeth and bones to measure radiation
- **Quote:** Utah considered ideal due to "low-use population segment"

### Claim 2: Downwinders exposed to massive radiation

**AFFECTED POPULATIONS:**
- **Primary zones:** Nevada, Utah, Arizona
- **Secondary:** Idaho, Montana, Colorado
- **Estimated exposed:** 100,000-200,000 civilians
- **"Downwinders"** - official government term

**RADIATION LEVELS:**
- Some areas: 100x background radiation
- Milk contamination: 100x safe levels
- Iodine-131 in children's thyroids
- Strontium-90 in bones

### Claim 3: Cancer rates skyrocketed

**NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE STUDY (1997):**
- **10x increase** in thyroid cancer
- **2-8x increase** in leukemia
- Breast cancer clusters documented
- Multiple rare cancers appearing

**SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES:**
- St. George, Utah: Called "Fallout City"
- Cancer rates: 40% above normal
- Multiple cancers per family common
- Children especially affected

### Claim 4: Government covered up and denied

**DENIAL TACTICS:**
- Classified health studies for decades
- Told residents radiation was safe
- "A little radiation is good for you" - AEC
- Destroyed/classified evidence

**SUPPRESSED STUDIES:**
- **1965 Weiss Report:** Showed direct cancer link
- Classified until 1979
- Scientists threatened if they spoke
- Media given false information

### Claim 5: Minimal compensation after decades

**RADIATION EXPOSURE COMPENSATION ACT (1990):**
- **$50,000** for cancer victims
- **$75,000** for uranium workers
- **$100,000** for test site workers
- Must prove residence and specific cancers

**COMPENSATION REALITY:**
- Burden of proof on victims
- Many cancers not covered
- Geographic limits exclude many
- $2.5 billion paid to date
- Thousands denied

## Human Guinea Pig Programs

**PROJECT 4.1 (MARSHALL ISLANDS):**
- Studied radiation effects on Marshallese
- Called them "subjects" not patients
- Resettled on contaminated islands
- Ongoing genetic damage

**UTAH SHEEP KILLS:**
- 4,500 sheep died after 1953 test
- Government denied, then classified evidence
- Ranchers ruined, never compensated
- Pattern of livestock deaths documented

## Specific Test Disasters

**SHOT HARRY (MAY 19, 1953):**
- 32 kiloton bomb
- Fallout hit St. George directly
- Children playing in "snow" (fallout)
- Acute radiation sickness reported

**OPERATION CASTLE BRAVO (1954):**
- 15 megaton explosion (3x predicted)
- Contaminated 7,000 square miles
- Japanese fishing boat crew poisoned
- Marshall Islands uninhabitable

## Government Admissions

**CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS:**
- 1979: First admissions of exposure
- Documents revealed deliberate exposure
- Scientists knew dangers in 1940s

**PRESIDENTIAL APOLOGIES:**
- Clinton (1995): Acknowledged harm
- No full disclosure or records
- Many documents still classified

## Modern Parallels

**ONGOING CONTAMINATION:**
- Hanford Site leaking into Columbia River
- Los Alamos groundwater contamination
- Savannah River Site pollution
- No comprehensive cleanup

**NEW EXPOSURES:**
- Depleted uranium weapons
- Burn pits in Iraq/Afghanistan
- Fracking radiation releases
- Nuclear waste transport
