# Source Documentation: "The Trail Where They Cried"

## Song Overview
This song tells the truth about the Trail of Tears - the forced removal of 100,000 Native Americans from their ancestral lands, resulting in 15,000+ deaths. The Cherokee called it "Nunna daul Tsuny" (The Trail Where They Cried). It was genocide for gold and cotton land.
