# Source Documentation: "The Tuskegee Experiment"

## Song Overview
This song exposes the 40-year US government medical experiment that deliberately left Black men with syphilis untreated to study the disease progression, even after penicillin cure was available. The horror ended only when a whistleblower went to the press in 1972.
