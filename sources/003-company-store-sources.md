## Song Overview
This song draws direct parallels between 1920s coal company exploitation and modern corporate practices at Amazon, Walmart, and other major employers. The same tactics of wage suppression, captive markets, and worker control persist with updated methods.

### Direct Historical Parallels

#### Company Control Mechanisms - Then vs Now

**1920s COAL TOWNS:**
- Paid in company scrip
- Must shop at company store
- 10-20% markup on goods
- Debt bondage through credit
- Private police forces
- Eviction for organizing

**2020s CORPORATIONS:**
- Wages requiring food stamps
- Scheduling prevents second jobs
- Healthcare tied to employment
- Debt through 401k loans
- Surveillance and metrics
- Firing for organizing

#### Congressional Documentation

**HISTORICAL:**
- US Coal Commission Report 1923
- Congressional hearings on company stores
- Fair Labor Standards Act proceedings

**MODERN:**
- GAO-21-45 Report on working families
- Senate HELP Committee Amazon Investigation
- House Education & Workforce Committee studies

## Key Statistical Comparisons

### Wage Suppression
- **1920s:** Miners paid $0.80/day for few days monthly
- **2020s:** Amazon workers qualify for food stamps despite "competitive" wages

### Corporate Profits vs Worker Poverty
- **1920s:** Coal companies profited while miners died in debt
- **2020s:** Walmart family worth $247 billion while employees on Medicaid

### Government Subsidization
- **1920s:** State militias protected company interests
- **2020s:** Taxpayers subsidize corporate wages through $6.2 billion in benefits

## Additional Verification Resources

### Books and Academic Studies
- "The Company Store" by EH.net Economic History Association
- "Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price" documentary
- Journal of Economic History archives on company towns

### Government Archives

## Why This Matters

The song reveals how exploitation tactics remain constant across centuries:
- Create economic dependency
- Suppress wages below living standards
- Externalize costs to taxpayers
- Use law and force to prevent organizing
- Extract maximum profit from desperate workers

The only changes are the methods - the pattern remains identical.
