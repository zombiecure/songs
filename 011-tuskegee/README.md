## The Story
"Your government would never experiment on its own people." Really? For 40 years, they watched Black men die from syphilis they could have cured. Called it research. The survivors got an apology in 1997.

## Chords
Verse:  Am - Dm - G - C
Chorus: F - C - G - Am
Bridge: Dm - Am - E - Am

## Verified Facts
- 1932-1972: 40 years of medical torture
- 600 Black men enrolled, 399 had syphilis
- Penicillin cure available since 1947 - withheld
- 128 men died, 40 wives infected, 19 children born with syphilis
- Source: CDC admits everything on their website

## The Lies They Told
- "Free healthcare for bad blood"
- Never told them they had syphilis
- Never told them there was a cure
- Gave placebos and watched them die
- Called it the "Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male"

## How It Ended
- 1972: Whistleblower Peter Buxtun went to press
- Public outrage forced shutdown
- 1974: $10 million settlement (not nearly enough)
- 1997: President Clinton apologized
- Last survivor died in 2004

## The Pattern Never Stopped
- Guatemala syphilis experiments (1946-48)
- Prison experiments nationwide
- Forced sterilizations
- Birth control tested on Puerto Rican women
- COVID vaccine hesitancy? They remember

## Trust, Once Broken
This is why Black Americans have lowest vaccination rates.
40 years of "trust your doctor" while doctors killed them.
The damage echoes through generations.
