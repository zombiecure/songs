TULSA'S BLACK WALL STREET
Written for the Zombie Cure Project

[Verse 1]
In nineteen twenty-one in Tulsa town
There was a place called Greenwood Avenue
Black Wall Street where success was found
Till jealous white folks burned it through

[Verse 2]
One hundred eight businesses thriving strong
Two banks, one hospital, a bus line too
Doctors, lawyers, working all day long
Till May thirty-first when hell broke through

[Chorus]
They burned Black Wall Street to the ground
'Cause success while Black ain't allowed
Three hundred dead in unmarked graves
While the white mob shouted and raved
They dropped bombs from planes overhead
On Americans in their own beds
Don't remember? That's by design
Erased from history's timeline

[Verse 3]
Six thousand locked up in detention camps
While their homes burned, no charges filed
Insurance claims denied with rubber stamps
"Riot exclusion" - records defiled

[Verse 4]
Thirty-five blocks reduced to ash
Ten thousand homeless in one night
All because they'd built up too much cash
And dared to prosper in plain sight

[Bridge]
They cut it from the textbooks
Destroyed the photographs
Threatened any witness
Who spoke of white folks' wrath
Took seventy years to even say
That Tulsa had its judgment day

[Verse 5]
Now they're finding mass graves with ground radar
Bodies hidden for a century's time
Every skeleton another star
Fallen for the economic crime

[Final Chorus]
Of building wealth while being Black
Of fighting back when under attack
Of creating your own American dream
When you weren't supposed to have the means
Black Wall Street was America too
Till America burned it through

[Outro - Spoken]
Oklahoma Commission Report, 2001
Death toll: 300+ (they stopped counting)
Property damage: $32 million in today's dollars
Insurance claims paid: Zero
Mass graves still being discovered in 2024
Not in your history book?
Now you know why
