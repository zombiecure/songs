[Intro - Spoken]
"My great-granddaddy died owing money to the company store in Matewan. Thought we'd learned that lesson... turns out we just got better technology."

[Verse 1 - The Old Days]
Granddaddy dug coal for scrip not cash
Bought his bread from the company stash
Owed his soul by the time he died
Sheriff Blair kept the owners' side

[Verse 2 - The New Ways]
Now we work at warehouses, badge and scan
Fifteen bucks an hour for the working man
But forty percent need food stamps to eat
While Bezos counts billions from his seat

[Chorus - Same Old Song]
Company store, company store
Different name but same old war
They own the goods, they own the town
Keep us broke to keep us down

[Verse 3 - The Numbers]
Matewan miners: eighty cents a day
Amazon workers: can't afford to stay
One point three million wearing that vest
While the boss made fifty-six billion last

[Verse 4 - The Pattern]
From Birmingham steel to Tyson meat
Same old game, same old beat
Prison labor at thirty cents an hour
Building wealth from someone else's power

[Bridge - Wake Up Call]
Black lung then, repetitive strain now
Different century, same old vow:
"Work hard and you'll get ahead"
While half the workforce can't afford bread

[Verse 5 - The Truth]
In 1920, they shot miners dead
In 2025, they track every tread
Your great-grandkids will owe their souls
To whatever company controls

[Outro Tag - Spoken with guitar strum]
"Baldwin-Felts agents became HR departments. Coal camps became fulfillment centers. Scrip became credit cards. But it's still the same old company store. Don't believe me? Count how many of your coworkers qualify for government assistance while your boss buys another yacht. Look it up - Matewan Massacre, May 19, 1920. Then look at your own paycheck. See any difference?"

[Final Chorus - Building]
Company store, company store
Your kids will owe it even more
Unless we see their same old game
Nothing changes but the name
